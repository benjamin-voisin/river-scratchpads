It is currently possible to have scratchpads like comportments in River, but
they are not very good : the focus is not set on the view oppened, they only
work on one screen, they can tile randomly.

This projects aims to provides better scrathpads features to River, meaning :
- Toggle a scratchpad.
- Focus on a view from the scratchpad (to be determined by the user).
- Put in in addition to current focused tags, or replace them.
- Send a command to the layout generator.
- Make it output agnostic (the same scratchpad can be summonned on any screens).
